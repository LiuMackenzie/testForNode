That means you write the same code to get and store things like users, whether they live in Redis, MySQL, MongoDB, or Postgres.\n\nWaterline strives to inherit the best parts of ORMs like ActiveRecord, Hibernate, and Mongoose, but with a fresh perspective and emphasis on modularity, testability, and consistency across adapters.\n\nFor detailed documentation, go to [Waterline Documentation](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline-docs) repository.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall from NPM.\n\n```bash\n$ npm install waterline\n```\n\n## Overview\n\nWaterline uses the concept of an Adapter to translate a predefined set of methods into a query that can be understood by your data store. Adapters allow you to use various datastores such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc. and have a clear API for working with your model data.\n\nIt also allows an adapter to define it's own methods that don't necessarily fit into the CRUD methods defined by default in Waterline. If an adapter defines a custom method, Waterline will simply pass the function arguments down to the adapter.\n\nYou may also supply an array of adapters and Waterline will map out the methods so they are both mixed in. It works similar to Underscore's [Extend](http://underscorejs.org/#extend) method where the last item in the array will override any methods in adapters before it. This allows you to mixin both the traditional CRUD adapters such as MySQL with specialized adapters such as Twilio and have both types of methods available.\n\n#### Community Adapters\n\n  - [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-postgresql) - *0.9+ compatible*\n  - [MySQL](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-mysql) - *0.9+ compatible*\n  - [MongoDB](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-mongo) - *0.9+ compatible*\n  - [Memory](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-memory) - *0.9+ compatible*\n  - [Disk](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-disk) - *0.9+ compatible*\n  - [Microsoft SQL Server](https://github.com/cnect/sails-sqlserver)\n  - [Redis](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-redis)\n  - [Riak](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-riak)\n  - [IRC](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-irc)\n  - [Twitter](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-twitter)\n  - [JSDom](https://github.com/mikermcneil/sails-jsdom)\n  - [Neo4j](https://github.com/natgeo/sails-neo4j)\n  - [OrientDB](https://github.com/appscot/sails-orientdb)\n  - [ArangoDB](https://github.com/rosmo/sails-arangodb)\n  - [Apache Cassandra](https://github.com/dtoubelis/sails-cassandra)\n  - [GraphQL](https://github.com/wistityhq/waterline-graphql)\n  - [Solr](https://github.com/sajov/sails-solr)\n  - [Apache Derby](https://github.com/dash-/node-sails-derby)\n\n\n## Support\nNeed help or have a question?\n- [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/waterline)\n- [Gitter Chat Room](https://gitter.im/balderdashy/sails)\n\n\n## Issue Submission\nPlease read the [issue submission guidelines](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#opening-issues) before opening a new issue.\n\nWaterline and Sails are composed of a [number of different sub-projects](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/blob/master/MODULES.md), many of which have their own dedicated repository. If you suspect an issue in one of these sub-modules, you can find its repo on the [organization](https://github.com/balderdashy) page, or in [MODULES.md](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/blob/master/MODULES.md).
